# A program which gives the absolute value of a number
# Author: Michael Crampton
# In the question, floats were used, so floats are being used for the output as no specific instruction was given.
number = float(input("Enter a number:"))
absoluteValue = abs(number)
print('The absolute value of {} is {}'.format(number, absoluteValue))
